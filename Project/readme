House Value Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the value of houses in California using machine learning techniques. The California Housing dataset was used for this project, and different machine learning models were trained and tested to predict the value of houses based on various features such as median income, total rooms, population, and more.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the California Housing dataset in CSV format.
src/: Contains the source code for the project.
results/: Contains the results of running the machine learning models.
Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.6 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Navigate to the src/ directory.
Run the main.py script to train and test the machine learning models.
The results will be saved in the results/ directory.
Results
The different machine learning models were trained and tested on the California Housing dataset, and the following results were obtained:

Logistic Regression:

RMSE: 0.327
R2 Score: 0.66
KNN:

RMSE: 0.289
R2 Score: 0.737
Random Forest:

RMSE: 0.225
R2 Score: 0.84
The random forest model performed the best, with an RMSE of 0.225 and an R2 score of 0.84.

Future Work
Some recommendations for future work include exploring other feature selection techniques, tuning hyperparameters, collecting more data, trying ensemble learning techniques, and deploying the model to a real-time environment.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project showcases the importance of feature selection and engineering in machine learning, and how it can be used to accurately predict the value of houses. The techniques used in this project can be extended to other domains and scaled to handle large datasets.
